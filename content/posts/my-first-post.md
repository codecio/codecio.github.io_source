In a moment of madness I decided to buy a domain name.

Beyond using it for the AWS lab account for various DNS services, I decided to also use it for the www subdomain and Apex domain. A couple weeks later reading an article about static site generators, I found myself deciding between Antora or Hugo. Hugo seemed like the more light-weight choice to deploy and maintain. Created a src repo that uses github actions to publish to the repo connected to my github pages automagically.

And.... here we are. Stay tuned when I have more coffee.
